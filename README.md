Step 1: Install Wireshark
       Wireshark installed successfully
Step 2: Start Capturing on Your Active Network Interface
       Launch Wireshark.
Step 3: Generate Network Traffic
        Enter start
Step 4: Stop Capture After a Minute
        Click the red Stop button in the toolbar.
Step 5: Filter Captured Packets by Protocol
        http → to view HTTP packets
        dns → to view DNS packets
        tcp → to view TCP connections
        icmp → for ping/echo traffic
Step 6: Identify at Least 3 Different Protocols
        DNS
        TCP
        HTTP
        TLS 
        SSL 
Step 7: Export the Capture as a .pcap File
        I have made a document
Step 8: Summarize Your Findings
        I captured traffic for 1 minute while visiting websites and using ping.
        Protocols Observed:
        DNS: Used for resolving domain names (e.g., google.com).
        HTTP: Detected when browsing unencrypted websites.
        TCP: Underlying transport protocol for many communications.
        Notable Packets:
        Packet #5: A DNS query for google.com.
        Packet #12: An HTTP GET request.
        Packet #30: ICMP Echo Request (ping) to 8.8.8.8.
